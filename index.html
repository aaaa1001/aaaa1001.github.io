# Welcome to my online archive

This is the place where I will archive the interesting stuff that I find on the internet! It mostly contains computer books, forks of repos that I find interesting and stuff that I may not want immediately, but sure want to archive for future reference.

Some of the material, especially books may be copyrighted so use at your own risk!

	So many books, so little time.
